Lab 2: Simple Data Path

DESCRIPTION:

This lab requires the user to build a data path with user inputs, ALU, and a register file. The user interface is where the user chooses the read and write registers and the data source. The register file has four 4-bit registers. The ALU is a 4-bit bitwise left rotation circuit which takes inputs from 2 register files. The write register value comes either from the output of the ALU or from user input.
