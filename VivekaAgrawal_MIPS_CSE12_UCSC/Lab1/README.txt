Lab 1: Intro to Logic Simulation

Description: 

In Lab1, the user created truth tables and then used Multimedia Logic (MML) to create circuits which modeled those truth tables. The circuits created were by using wires and logic gates (AND, NAND, OR, NOR, NOT, and XOR).


Files:

Lab1.lgi 

This file is where the circuits were created in MML.


Instructions:

To run the simulation, MML is required.
