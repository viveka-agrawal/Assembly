Lab 4: Functions and Graphs

DESCRIPTION:

In this lab, users can change the background color of a display and draw lines on the display, which is possible because of the functions that the creator has implemented in order to perform these graphics operations. In order to make this possible, arrays, memory-mapped Input/Output (IO), subroutines (functions), macros, and the MIPS Stack will be used.

FILES:

lab4.asm

This file contains the MIPS code.

INSTRUCTIONS:

To run the program, MARS is required.
